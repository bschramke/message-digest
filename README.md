MessageDigest library for C++
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bschramke/message-digest.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bschramke/message-digest)

libMessageDigest is an free and easy-to-use message digest library for C++.

Why another message digest library?
--------------------------------------
Sure, there are many message digest implementations in the net and they are all fine.
Most of them are written in C and/or part of larger libraries. The aim of libMessageDigest 
is to provide different hashing algorithms and make them accessible through an simple 
base class (like java.security.MessageDigest), without introducing external dependencies.

Supported algorithms
--------------------------------------
libMessageDigest currently supports the following algorithms:
* CRC32
* MD5
* SHA1

How to use
--------------------------------------
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "MessageDigest/MessageDigest.hpp"

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;

  std::unique_ptr<MessageDigest> md5 = MessageDigest::createInstance("MD5");
  md5->update("Hello World!");
  cout << md5->digest();
  
  return 0;
}

```
